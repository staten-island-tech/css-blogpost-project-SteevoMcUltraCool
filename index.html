        <p> Hello deditcated bloggers. I was trying to DESTROY my arch enemy sonic, but he destroyed my mechanical suit!
          Luckily, the amazing, incredible, superior Steevo McCool swooped faster than sonic speed and beat sonic up for
          me. I am just a poor old man who needs some of Sonic's speed, and Steevo McCool was able to defeat sonic in
          just 30 seconds. I have been trying for almost 30 years! Wow! He really is cool. After that, we got churros
          and talked. He is funny, smart, and genuinely amazing at everything from math to football to chess. He is also
          incredible handsome, but what really shines through is his humility. Thank you Steevo McCool! You saved my
          world!</p>

        <p> Oh ma goodness! Steevo McCool is so lame! I literally saw him at this looser anime convention.I mean he was
          definately the most awesome one there but STILL! ONLY LOOSERS GO THERE GET A LIFE U BUM. he is not all that he
          is talked out to be. If you squint really hard, you can kind of see him in the top left of the image. If you
          can't find him, just look for the best looking guy there. He is really handsome I must admite: BUT. NOT. IN.

        <p> Hello there! My name is Stephanie Coolette. I am a cheer team captian at SI Technical high school and Steevo
          McCool is my hero. Our cheer team was dismal. We never practiced because- there was no reason to. Our football
          team got no attendence, there was never any cheer hangouts. But then Steevo McCool came and changed
          everything. He saved our football team with his amazing kicks and touchdown. Our cheer team became motivated
          and we practiced. I felt a sense of purpose all because of Steevo McCool. Thank you so much Steevo McCool. We
          also started to practice more because Steevo McCool recieved a private invite to all of our cheer practices
          (amongst other invitations to grand events). Steevo McCool is a hero and the world just needs to know about
          it.
